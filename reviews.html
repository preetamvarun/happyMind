As someone who likes to be in control or to never feel weak, seeking help has been a lifelong struggle. Once I finally committed to the platform, I was given a therapist that did not feel helpful. It almost shuttered my experience but I decided to give one more chance &amp; chose Dr. A. From the beginning, I felt very comfortable &amp; immediately understood as we navigate my issues. It&#039;s been great thus far. Highly recommend Dr. Armburster.</p>

I was so skeptical  about starting  therapy and wasn’t even sure I needed it, but oh my goodness, what Constance has directed me to explore in my own mind has totally transformed my way of thinking about real issues going on in my life. She is so in tune with me and helps address confusion and problems in my own mind through support, exploration  and care for me as an individual. 
Constance is an exceptional  counsellor and I’ll be forever indebted to her for helping me get on the right track to start the rest of my life. </p>

He knew what I needed when He put her in my stream of choices. She has been professional yet personable. I don&#039;t feel disconnected or like I&#039;m a case study or a number. She listens and takes in what I put out. She then gives me individualized, sound advice. She helps me to see myself, my actions, my behavior in an introspectively and then look at myself from the outside looking in. She is an advocate, a resource, and a friend who doesn&#039;t judge me. She is a safe place for me to be completely open. If anyone is looking for the truth from someone who can hold up a mirror, with kindness, for them to see themselves and give their reflection a make-over...Jocelyn is the right choice. Be ready for work. She brings it. But you have to do the work for this real medicine to heal you.</p>

I believe in this sort time she seems to understand my feelings and thoughts and gets me on where I&#039;m trying to go and what I&#039;m trying to do to better myself.  I pray that this new found therapy- ship sustains.  

I didn&#039;t think I would go through with it let alone stay in it, but,  as I have said she makes it easy.  Though I know there maybe some challenges for me to get through down the line. However,  I feel very confident that with her assistance and guidance I will get through it. 

Thank you Mrs. Vickee</p>

Upon telling her I did not wish to continue, she basically told me &quot;good luck finding someone else&quot; when if she had taken the time to do a quick google search or two she&#039;d find that there are hundreds of experts on the topic of my underlying issue. I was really excited to work with this therapist based on her about me section but after our session, I hope no one has to go through what I went through.</p>

                        <p><strong>Is Online Therapy Any Good?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting online therapy can be just as valuable (if not more so) than getting in-office therapy. People who take part in online therapy often show a dramatic improvement in the circumstances of their lives based on the new insights learned in therapy. Some of the best online therapy benefits are the immediate reduction of stress over getting to in-office appointments and taking back control of your mental health care -- as opposed to not getting any therapy at all. Today&rsquo;s mental health clients have access to the best online therapy via licensed family therapists, licensed clinical social workers, and licensed professional counselors online 24-hours a day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online chat sessions are conducted in a question and answer format like face-to-face sessions&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Is There Online Therapy?</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental health professionals are making it easier for today&rsquo;s therapy clients to take part in live chat sessions, unlimited messaging therapy, and live chat with the same degreed and licensed professionals that you will find in hospitals, clinics, and private practice offices.

Other online therapy options start at as much as $99.00 per week to provide access to video conferencing therapy online or using mobile apps. Comparable services provided by online therapy providers like Doctor On Demand can start as much as $129.00 per visit using their mobile app. HappyMind provides similar services that includes the option to change therapists if you feel that your initial choice wasn&rsquo;t the best fit. People who suffer from chronic mental health issues that require ongoing therapy for issues like relationship counseling or teen counseling may find that the costs of platforms like Doctor on Demand aren&rsquo;t easy to manage over time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Can I Use Insurance for Online Therapy?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is up to the discretion of your therapy provider to decide if they will accept health insurance for behavioral therapy services. Major insurance providers like Blue Cross Blue Shield provide benefits for behavioral therapy appointments online. Online providers like Doctor on Demand mentioned above may also provide options for paying for relationship counseling or teen counseling using behavioral health insurance benefits. For teen counseling or other counseling sessions that aren&rsquo;t covered by insurance -- HappyMind can provide you with a record of your therapy sessions to submit to your insurance company for reimbursement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>What is the Best Online Therapy?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best online therapy is relative to you. Many online clients benefit from popular therapy modalities like cognitive behavioral therapy that focuses on changing maladaptive reliefs. Licensed therapists will work with you to develop a treatment plan using the best therapy options available for your unique situation. HappyMind provides top-notch therapy services that are comparable to those provided by more expensive services like Doctor on Demand -- and has become America&rsquo;s leading online therapy provider. In reality, the best online therapy is the therapy that leads you to blossoming into your best self.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>What are the Benefits of Online Therapy?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of online therapy are limitless. Many therapy clients enjoy the freedom that taking part in therapy via live video or live chat sessions via a secure platform provides. People who take part in video sessions for therapy often end up saving time and money on gas and travel time to traditional in-office therapy sessions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a wide-variety of online therapy options for individuals and families seeking individual counseling, teen counseling, relationship counseling, marriage and family counseling, and other beneficial mental health counseling -- at a price that they can afford. Expensive services like Doctor on Demand provide similar services to leading therapy platforms like HappyMind who provide individual, family, and teen counseling for a fraction of the cost of other online therapy providers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Is There a Free Online Therapist?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are options for getting free therapy online. The HappyMind therapy platform offers members a free trial to test drive their live chat sessions, video sessions, and unlimited messaging therapy for (7) days to get a feel for the platform.

More expensive therapy services like Doctor on Demand may also provide free or introductory consultations for therapy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Is Online Therapy Confidential?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolutely! Just like face-to-face therapy sessions in an in-office environment, licensed clinical social workers, licensed marriage and family therapists, and licensed professional counselors are required to maintain confidentiality regarding information shared in therapy sessions. People who login for online therapy via HappyMind&rsquo;s secure therapy platform gain access to confidential counseling services and therapy for a variety of challenging life issues. The platform uses secure video conferencing features to connect clients with confidential online mental health care services as an alternative to in-person therapy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>What are the Disadvantages of Counselling?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to maintaining good mental health, there are very few downsides to getting counseling. One of the main concerns for many people who take part in therapy is cost. The advent of online therapy services like HappyMind and their more expensive competitor, Doctor on Demand both still provide inexpensive alternatives to getting therapy than in-office appointments that can start at as much as $200.00 per hour.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Licensed mental health professionals are available to help clients to remove challenging obstacles in their lives that are preventing them from reaching their life goals. People who attend counseling understand that they are required to participate by diving deep, following the treatment plan recommended by their licensed mental health professional.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If any component of therapy can be seen as a disadvantage, it may be the discomfort that many therapy clients experience during the process of healing. This discomfort will likely be present regardless of whether you opt for face-to-face therapy or video sessions with licensed professional counselors. The process of healing mental health related traumas can be painful.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>What is Online Counseling Therapy?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online counseling therapy is where a chronic mental health sufferers and licensed mental health professional can connect to develop strategies for healing past trauma and developing better communication skills to improve the client's quality of mental health. Mental health clients and licensed therapists connect in a secure online environment via video sessions or live chat to deal with mental health issues.&nbsp;</span></p>

HappyMind offers unlimited access to mental health care services in the form of messaging therapy, phone calls, video conferencing, and live chat sessions online 24-hours a day. Getting started with unlimited messaging therapy is as easy as providing your contact information and registering with your email address.&nbsp;</span></p>
